Through its [config files](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Nutrition/wiki/Configuration), Nutrition allows you to define custom food groups (called [nutrients](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Nutrition/wiki/Nutrients)) which apply [effects](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Nutrition/wiki/Effects) based on nutrition levels.

By default, Nutrition comes configured with the classic five food group system: dairy, fruit, grain, protein, and vegetables.  However many different systems are possible.  Some examples include:

* A spicy tolerance bar, where eating enough spicy foods will grant a permanent resistance to fire.
* A zombie simulation where you must eat brains to avoid negative effects.
* Gluten intolerance.  Eat bread, get sick.

When updating the mod, please delete your `/config/nutrition/nutrients/` directory to receive new mod support.  This is necessary so we don't overwrite any customizations.

Mod support contributions are welcome!  Please create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Nutrition/pulls) or an [Issue](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Nutrition/issues) with the relevant .json files.
